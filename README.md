For CODTECH Internship Task-3, we created a simple lexical analyzer in C that scans a given input string and identifies keywords, identifiers, and operators — mimicking the first phase of a compiler. Since the Programiz Online C Compiler doesn’t support file input operations in a flexible way, we used a hardcoded string to simulate input code, making the analyzer self-contained and easy to test. We processed the input character-by-character and used standard C functions like isalnum() and strcmp() to distinguish between different token types. This task provided practical insight into how source code is broken down during compilation, and it laid the foundation for understanding compiler design concepts such as parsing and syntax analysis. In future applications, lexical analyzers are used in building compilers, interpreters, and syntax highlighters, and they are essential for any tool that processes or analyzes code.
